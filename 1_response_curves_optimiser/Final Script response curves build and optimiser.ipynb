    "Heineken has been one of the most successful companies in implementing efficient marketing strategies that drive revenue and ROI. In 2018, Heineken has tested multiple Individualised Data Driven Marketing (IDDM) campaigns, to support its Star Pubs & Bars customers with geo-targeted digital media, which proved to be incredibly successful. As a result, in 2020, IDDM was launched in nearly 30 markets, and Heineken has increased investments in video and audio streaming platforms, alongside with becoming more creative at bringing sponsorships into the virtual space, in order to drive e-commerce. The brewing giant doesn’t shy away from spending billions of pounds sterling on marketing and sales, in order to maintain its competitive position. In 2020, its marketing and sales budget reached £2.044 bln, and as the need to adapt faster to rising business challenges, like the unpredictable Covid-19 pandemic, there has never been a higher demand for efficient allocation of resources, and Data Science plays a crucial role in this process. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main sales metrics used by the company for measuring growth is volume of beverage sold, measured in millions of hectolitres (mhl). Heineken’s 2020 Annual Report announced a staggering 221.6 mhl of consolidated beer brands sold in 2020, and therefore predicting the effect of marketing efforts on volume growth is the main objective of the business.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The Marketing Data Science team works alongside and guides the Media Planning and Brand Managers by providing with necessary support from a data perspective, to ensure budget decisions are validated by data modelling techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "To support the work done by the Data Science team, Heineken has a series of existing tools available within the business, each of which have some limitations which block a more widespread adoption within its company:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Third party Marketing Mix Modelling(MMM) software tool provided by Mass Analytics. The tool is able to facilitate in defining the MMM suitable for Heineken brands. By inputting appropriate data, the tool is able to run appropriate transformations and simulations, and take into account factors like seasonality and n-degree multi variate synergies amongst variables, to assign appropriate coefficients to each element in the prediction model, that would accurately explain the variance in Volume of beer sold. One of the key challenges around the existing tool is the very high price of the license, and inherent black box approach, which limits the user from having visibility over transformations made to obtain model inputs. To alleviate this issue, the current project aims to decompose the current MMM model in order to derive those data transformations and use the MMM outputs for making better business decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Third party demo scenario tool called Polestar, which is used by the media planning team to create various budget scenarios across different media channels. The challenges with this resource are its limitation in its ability to predict impact on volume or revenue or create scenarios for more than 2 brands within the company, as well as the fact that it cannot run an optimisation with suitable variable constraints for each media channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Excel optimiser tool created by the Spanish Data Science team, which is not used by the UK stakeholders, as it’s not easily comprehensible or applicable to the brands owned by the UK business unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The company’s motivation consists in creating a new media scenario and optimisation tool with a user-friendly interface, that is easily replicable across various brands, and which can recommend optimal split for marketing budgets. Ideally, internal stakeholders should be able to easily input their budget constraints in order to obtain a recommendation of media laydown strategy."

    "## MMM, response curves, and other terms defined...\n",
    "Strategic marketing is key to a company’s success in the 21st century, and mastering this skill requires a unique blend of rational analysis, creativity and adaptability. (Kourdi, 2011) With an increased number of available media channels and marketing activities for promoting products and services, strategy is what creates the ultimate advantage. In order to determine the best course of action and the most efficient allocation of marketing resources in a competitive landscape, one must have a great understanding of the relative performance of each marketing metric, relative to brands belonging to the same category.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Marketing Mix Modelling is the analytical approach to this challenge, and its purpose is to evaluate the Return on Investment (ROI) as a function of various marketing drivers and recommend the optimal marketing budget allocations. The model often uses regression methods to estimate the response in demand to marketing investments, by accounting for long-term trends, which are derived from customer preferences, distribution, prices and other factors; and also, by accounting for incremental volumes, which may depend on promotions and online and offline media activity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of allocating budgets is directly linked to the optimal reassignment of media resources, subject to a set of constraints, typically budget constraints. Maximising revenue by minimising the total budget spend requires a thorough analysis of media response curves, which are the most popular output of Marketing Mix Models (MMMs). (Cain, 2014) \n",
    "\n",
    "The type of effects that can have an impact on MMM are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*The current effect* - is the impact that advertising has in the change in sales which is observed at the same time as the exposure period to the advertising itself.  \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "*The carryover effect* (Which is also known as Adstock Decay) is the impact if advertising that is recorded in periods of time after the exposure to advertising. This effect can be long, or short, and it can be caused by various aspects, for example: the consumer could make the purchase due to word of mouth from others who have been exposed to the ad, customers could have a slowed down response to the ad or even a delayed exposure from the moment of purchase of ad space (Print or TV have similar effects). \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "*The Shape effect* (which we refer to as diminishing returns value) is the portrayal of the relationship between sales and increase in advertising effort over the same period of time. Therefore, it is important to note that in our future simulation, the response curve is a portrayal of the effect on sales from spending more marketing budget during the same period. This relationship can take various shapes, which can be linear, concave, convex or S-shaped. Linear and Convex are very unlikely in the real world scenarios, however Concave and S-Shapes are most like to correspond to the natural behaviour of advertising, given that marketing expenditure at very low-levels can have very little effect due ads getting drowned in the noise, whilst a marketing budget that is set at an exaggerated level can decrease the impact on sales, as consumers become fatigued from over-exposure to the same ad, and the market becomes saturated. Thus, a moderate level of advertising effort would lead to higher expected response in sales. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "*Competitive effects* are captured in the variables of our model that measure competitors' advertising. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "*Dynamic effects* are the advertising effects that change as time changes, defined by carryover effects, wearin, wearout and hysteresis. Wearin is when the response to revenue or sales increases week by week, as an advertising campaign is run at the same level weekly, wearout is when the response decreases from week to week, as a result of consumer tedium, and hysteresis is a permanent effect even after the campaign is no longer running, which is a very unlikely and rare event. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "*Content effects* are the response difference due to the variation in ad creatives.  \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "*Media effects* are the variations in response to advertising which are caused by contextual placement of the ad - for example which channel is an ad placed on TV, or which story is the ad next to in the newspaper. "

By running this block of code, we will be prompted to input the desired channel. However, if an iterative prcoess is desired, we would have to replace the input with a for loop that iterates through the list of desired channels."
